Native plants garden, the “Huaycu”The huaycu, which means gorge in Spanish, is a geographical feature, oftentimes a hillside. In it, you can find a high biodiversity of plants and a lot of animals seeking shelter during the rain. Gorges, wasteland, and slopes inhabit plants with little to no economical use, for many just weeds. However, they are part of the biodiversity of the place, their roots protect the soil from erosions and they offer food and shelter for other organisms. The city of Quito lies in the midst of long andine gorges and slopes. In recent years the urban planning and extensions of the city border has led to crucial damage on the plant cover of the gorges. Even so, the full plant cover can still be found in some places, like for example at the rivers shores, the adjacent valleys and the City’s parks Metropolitano and Itchimbia. Quito’s location, close to the equator and with the extreme variation of heights, starting from the peak of the Guagua Pichincha at 4776 meters down to the canyon of the river Guayllabamba at 2100 meters. These factors are responsible for the high amount of native plants which adapted and evolved to live in the valley of Quito.
