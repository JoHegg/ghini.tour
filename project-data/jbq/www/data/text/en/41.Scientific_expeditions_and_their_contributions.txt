	Scientific expeditions and their contributionsThe first scientific mission	 coming to Hispanic America was the French Geodesic Mission from 1735 to 1744. Geodesy is the science of measuring the size and shape of Earth. After this mission many of the explorers were associated with our plants; Charles-Marie de la Condamine, a French explorer, geographer, mathematician and the head of the expedition, who came to Ecuador to measure the length of a degree latitude at the equator, is today associated with the quinina de Loja; Antonio de Ulloa, a Spanish general of the navy and explorer with the plants of the páramo.; Joseph de Jussieu, a French botanist and naturalist, with the plants from the Real Audiencia de Quito, an administrative unit in the Spanish empire which had the power over territories that today include whole Ecuador, northern parts of Peru, southern parts of Colombia and northern parts of Brazil.In 1802 Alexander von Humboldt and Aimé Bonpland, traveled through Central and Southern America from 1799 to 1804, were living in the house of Juan Pio Montúfar in Quito, Marqués de Selva Alegre, later president of the board of governors of autonomous Quito and an important figure in the Independence movement of Ecuador.
